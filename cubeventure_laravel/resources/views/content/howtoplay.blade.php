<h1><strong> How to play </strong></h1>

<h2><strong> Introduction </strong></h2><br><br>
<div style="margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 10px; text-align: justify">
    <strong> CubeVenture </strong> is game based on speed of your movement and logical thinking. Main goal is to get your cube from start point into
    end point, however it will not be that easy. Along the way there is many challenges awaiting you whether it is in form of puzzle or in form of
    enemies which you will either have to avoid or pacify. You start as an non-coloured cube, but to progress in the game, you will have to explore and
    pick up gems scattered in each level, while keeping you speed, since the time is ticking and the longer it will take you, the lower your final
    score will be. So be aware of fast movement, quick thinking and having fun!

    <h3> Movement </h3>
    <p>As we mentioned above in introduction, one of main component to you new high score will be <strong>movement</strong>. Movement is quite
        simple and intuitive. You will be using good old gaming key <strong>WASD</strong> as in which <strong style="color: #D18700;">W</strong> - for front
        movement, <strong style="color: #D18700;">A</strong> - movement to the left, <strong style="color: #D18700;">S</strong> - backwards
        movement and finally <strong style="color: #D18700;">D</strong> - for movement to the right side.

    <h3> Gems </h3>
    <img src="{{ asset('images/gems.gif') }}">
    <p>Collecting <strong>gems</strong> is one of the main mechanics of CubeVenture, since you have to collect gems of different color in order for your cube side
        to change color. It is important to collect all or as many of the gems as you are able to, because most of the time you will not be able to
        continue your journey without them. Often you will not need all of the gems to complete particular level, but you will need all of them in
        order to complete the level on 100% or to access bonus area where you can collect additional loot like coins, which you can then use
        to buy yourself something in our beautiful shop.

    <h3> Gates </h3>
    <p>Well we have been talking a lot about collecting gems in order to color your side of cube, or to complete the level, but we did not yet
        mention why is that a necessity. In all levels there will be <strong>gates</strong> which will be blocking your
        path, and in order to open them for a brief amount of time you will have to activate pressure plate connected to that particular gate,
        with appropriate color of your cube's side. If you do not possess the color needed just keep wandering around the level, it will be there
        somewhere for sure!

    <h3> Enemies </h3>
    <img src="{{ asset('images/enemy.gif') }}">
    <p>On your journey in CubeVenture you will encounter <strong>enemies</strong> of various colors. That is another reason why you will be, more
        or less, forced to collect those colorful gems. In order to pacify the enemy, you will have to smash him with a correct side and color on
        your cube, otherwise the enemy will hit you and you will be respawned back at the beginning of level. The enemies properties change based
        on the difficulty that you had selected before starting the level, so also be aware of that. If you will be having a hard time, you can
        always change the difficulty back.

    <img src="{{ asset('images/laser.gif') }}">
    <h3> Lasers </h3>
    <p>Another main mechanic of CubeVenture are <strong>lasers</strong>. Do not worry they will not hurt you *phew*, however you will have to
        put your logic to work in order to proceed in level further. There will be couple of lasers in each level, which you will have to redirect
        with <strong>movable blocks</strong> in that particular area. Each of those blocks have different shape and therefore the laser
        interacts with them in different manner, so go ahead experiment with them and find out how each shape or angle interact with laser to
        achieve your goal. Oh, and your goal is to get out of this place by the second portal, which will activate only when all lasers are
        correctly activated.

    <h3> Coins & Stars </h3>
    <img src="{{ asset('images/coins.gif') }}">
    <p>Wandering around the level and looking for that last <strong>star or coin</strong>? Try to look somewhere unusual, somewhere where you
        will have to leave the main trail. <strong>Stars</strong> represent how good of understanding you have at each particular level and they
        are also used as score booster, so try to pick all of them on your journey so that you can get that #1 on that leaderboard of ours!
        <strong>Coins</strong> are also scattered around the level on either linear or more unexpected locations. They serve as in-game currency
        for which you player are able to buy customizations for your character, whether it is hat on your cube or even a brand new cube model!
