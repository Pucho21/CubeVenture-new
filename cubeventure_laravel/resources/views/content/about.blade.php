<h1><strong> About Us </strong></h1>
<p>
    <strong style="color: #D18700;">ThreeLancers</strong> is company which was founded in 2021 however we have been working together for some time before already.
    We are a team of 3 young college students, who are looking for som practical experience. Our field of study is Applied Informatics
    so our main focus is around computers. Our main focus is around in software / game development  and also in many web technologies.
    Since We want to gain as much practical experience as possible before finishing the college, We decided to start some side projects
    while studying, since that is really good way of putting our knowledge into practice. So far we developed couple of games and some web
    pages with which our clients are very happy so far, We also provide administration of Our products, based on our agreement.
    Our current projects that We are working on are couple of games and accounting software for one company.
    We believe that this way we will learn much more than just being in college while studying mainly theoretical things.

        Like my colleagues, I had a passion for computers, especially computer games, from an early age, and it has remained with me
        until now. Therefore, I decided to go to study Aplied Informatics, where I learned a lot of new things. however, I was most
        interested in and enjoyed things like working with databases and overall programming and writing code, whether as php pages,
        game development or applications development. I learned how to look for the information I need and adjust it for my need and how
        to improvise in programming and therefore I have no problem working on the development of new things, I always take it as a new
        experience and an opportunity to learn something new. In conclusion, I would like to add that I am glad that my colleagues and I
        have set up this team and I hope you will hear more about us in the future.

        Since high school I decided that I wanted to study Applied Informatics and that is because you are able to create
        so many various things just by basically learning basic fundamentals of programming language. As I mentioned in the sentence above,
        I like to create things which looks good. This is reason why my main specialization in IT would be webpage development or
        development of web technologies or software development in general. I also have experience as team leader in project development
        where I learned many new things like agile approaches for example using SCRUM approach or framework Laravel. That is the main reason
        why we founded this company, because along with my colleagues I am looking for examples from practice where I, as programmer or leader
        of a team, or really any position, am able to put my theoretical knowledge into real world use, where I can learn what the customer
        terms are and how to approach them. So that would be all from me, hope you having fun browsing this web-site!

        I have been interested in computer technology since childhood, which was my reason why I became a student of applied informatics.
        Since games have always been my passion, I decided to program one of my own one day. Already during college, I worked on several
        indie projects, some of which are available for download. Therefore, I would say that one of my strengths is programming and
        application development. I like learning new things, which is a trait that keeps me moving forward.
